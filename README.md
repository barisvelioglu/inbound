# Inbound.js

Inbound.js provides modern javascript data binding and view synchronization by employing native `Object` getters and setters combined with `MutationObserver`.

## Benefits of Inbound.js

- Not a framework
- Native, real-time data binding (no dirty checking)
- Makes no assumptions about your application architecture
- No other library dependencies
- ES5 compatible down to IE9 (without `MutationObserver` features)
- Encourages a MAD (modular application development) pattern
- Discourages a FAD (framework application development) pattern
